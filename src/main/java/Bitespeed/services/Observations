 My observations and findings need to be rectified based on my project's API POST requests
 from Postman:


1) In my service class logic, I need to set the linked ID as null while saving primary contact
details.

2) When sending two different requests with different emails â€” one primary and the other secondary-
if the linked phone numbers are the same for both requests, the linked phone number list has to be saved
in the secondary contact details.but in the out i am getting same phoneNumber added twice in the list.

3) The Output fields are not in the expected order as mentioned in the requirement.

4) After manually deleting rows of data from the database(Suppose i delete 5 rows), the ID should
reset to 0. For the next request, DB should start saving the contact from ID-1.

5) If a request is sent with a null phone number and only an email, it works as expected. However, if
an ID already has a phone number present and the email is null, sending another request with a
phone number and a null email results in an error.

Finding:
This error occurs because, seems the code does not handle cases where a phone number is
present and the email is null- need to handle string.equal method correctly for email.

6) The system successfully prevents duplicate data entry when the same request is sent multiple
times (e.g., with the same email and phone number).
